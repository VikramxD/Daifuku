# ✨ Feature Request

**Summary**  
*A one-line summary of the proposed feature.*  
Example: "Add support for multi-language prompts in the text-to-video API."

---

## 💡 Problem  
*What is the current problem or limitation that this feature will address? Be clear and specific.*  
Example: "Currently, the API only supports English prompts, which limits adoption in non-English-speaking regions."

---

## 🎯 Desired Outcome  
*What should happen when this feature is implemented? What’s the ideal user experience?*  
Example: "Users should be able to submit prompts in multiple languages and receive accurate outputs without needing manual translations."

---

## 🛠 Proposed Solution  
*Describe your proposed solution in detail. Focus on how it improves the current experience.*  
Example:
- Integrate a translation module (e.g., Huggingface MarianMT) for real-time translation.  
- Add a `language` parameter to the API for specifying input language.  
- Ensure generated content maintains original prompt context after translation.

---

## 🔍 Alternatives  
*What other approaches or solutions have you considered? Why do they fall short?*  
Example:
1. **External Translation API**: Not viable due to additional latency and cost.  
2. **Manual Pre-Translation**: Puts an unnecessary burden on users.

---

## 🌟 Impact  
*Who will benefit from this feature? How does it align with the project’s goals?*  
Example: "This will expand the API’s usability to global audiences, particularly for creative professionals in non-English-speaking regions."

---

## 🚀 Implementation Ideas  
*(Optional)* Any technical or design considerations to keep in mind? Suggest libraries, frameworks, or methods to use.  
Example:
- Use `langdetect` to auto-detect input language.  
- Train fine-tuned translation models for specific domains like video descriptions.

---

## 📚 Resources & References  
*(Optional)* Include any supporting documentation, links, screenshots, or diagrams to provide context.  
Example:
- [Huggingface MarianMT Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/marian)  
- [Example API Usage](https://example.com/docs)

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria  
*(Optional)* Define what "done" looks like for this feature.  
Example:
- The API accepts prompts in multiple languages.  
- Outputs are consistent in quality with English prompts.  
- Documentation includes updated API usage examples.
